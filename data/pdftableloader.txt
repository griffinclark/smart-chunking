PDF Table Loader
This loader reads the tables included in the PDF.

Users can input the PDF file and the pages from which they want to extract tables, and they can read the tables included on those pages.

Usage
Here's an example usage of the PDFTableReader. pages parameter is the same as camelot's pages. Therefore, you can use patterns such as all, 1,2,3, 10-20, and so on.

from llama_hub.pdf_table import PDFTableReader
from pathlib import Path

reader = PDFTableReader()
pdf_path = Path('/path/to/pdf')
documents = reader.load_data(file=pdf_path, pages='80-90')
