Multi-Modal LLM using Replicate LlaVa, Fuyu 8B, MiniGPT4 models for image reasoning
In this notebook, we show how to use MultiModal LLM class for image understanding/reasoning. We now support:

LLava-13B

Fuyu-8B

MiniGPT-4

In the 2nd part, we show how to use stream complete and aync complate for Replicate.

NOTE: At the moment, the Replicate multi-modal LLMs only support one image document at a time.

test_images/2.png

llava-13b

is there anything unusual in the image?

Yes, there is an unusual element in the image. The man is holding a gold trophy, which is not uncommon. However, he is also holding a microphone, which is an unusual combination. Typically, a person holding a microphone would be a speaker or an announcer, while a trophy is usually associated with an award or achievement. The combination of the microphone and the trophy suggests that the man might be a presenter or an announcer who is also receiving an award or acknowledging someone else’s achievement.

test_images/0.png

fuyu-8b

is there anything unusual in the image?

 Yes, there is something unusual in the image, as there is a golden ball or trophy being held by a man wearing a suit. This is unusual because typically, sports balls or trophies are associated with competitions or achievements, rather than being worn by a person in a suit. The man holding the golden ball or trophy is wearing a suit, which adds to the peculiarity of the scene.

test_images/0.png

minigpt-4

is there anything unusual in the image?

The image shows a man in a black suit and tie holding a golden trophy. The trophy has a design on it that looks like a soccer ball. The man is smiling and appears to be happy.

llava-13b

is there anything unusual in the image?

Yes, there is an unusual aspect in the image. The Colosseum, a famous ancient Roman amphitheater, is lit up with colored lights, which is not a common sight. This illumination adds a unique and vibrant touch to the otherwise historical and majestic structure.

4

test_images/1.png

fuyu-8b

is there anything unusual in the image?

 Yes, the image features an unusual scene, as multiple people are walking around the colossal structure, which is an old Roman amphitheater. The amphitheater is illuminated with colorful lights, giving it a vibrant and lively atmosphere.

is there anything unusual in the image?

The image shows the Colosseum, a large amphitheater in Rome, Italy. It is a well known landmark and tourist attraction.

2

test_images/1.png

llava-13b

is there anything unusual in the image?

Yes, there is something unusual in the image. The two cartoon minions are standing next to each other, but one of them has a tooth missing. This is an unusual detail, as it is not common for animated characters to have imperfections like missing teeth. The missing tooth adds a unique and interesting aspect to the image, making it stand out from typical animated scenes.

3

test_images/2.png

fuyu-8b

is there anything unusual in the image?

 Yes, there is an unusual aspect of the image, as there are two minions dressed in overalls, wearing goggles, and standing next to each other. This unusual combination is not typical, as minions are typically associated with their popular animation and movie franchises. The minions’ overalls, goggles, and overalls-wearing, combined with the goggles they are wearing, adds to the peculiarity of the scene.

minigpt-4

is there anything unusual in the image?

The image appears to be a cartoon character with overalls and a yellow shirt. The character is smiling and has a blue hat on its head. There is nothing unusual in the image.

Summary of preliminary findings with evaluated Multi-Modal Models
First, the purpose of this notework is to show how to leverage Replicate for serving different Multi-Modal LLMs for image reasoning tasks. There are some limitations with such comparison:

We compared and evaluated LLaVa-13B, Fuyu-8B, and MiniGPT-4 for some simple and limited tasks/prompts.

Note that the hyperparameters for different models are the same in the example. The power of hyperparamters tuning could be significant for the quality MM LLMs models.

Human evaluation could have some Bias/Subjectivity/Noise

Some preliminary findings:

MiniGPT-4 sometimes can yield a more accurate answer like There are two minions in the image. instead of There are two people shown in the image. from LlaVa or Fuyu-8B. Another example is that MiniGPT-4 answers Colosseum directly for the question what is it in the image for the Italy Colosseum image.

MiniGPT-4 failed to give results for two prompts. It answers I'm sorry, but I cannot see the image you provided. But it can answer other questions for the same images. Not sure it is an issue of Replicate inference or MiniGPT-4 model itself

Fuyu-8B and LlaVa-13B usually yield longer verbose answers to the question with more context to support.

Llava-13B and Fuyu-8B sometimes yield slightly higher hallucination espeically for the question is there anything unusual in the image?
