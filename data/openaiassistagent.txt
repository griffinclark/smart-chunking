OpenAI Assistant Agent
Open In Colab

This shows you how to use our agent abstractions built on top of the OpenAI Assistant API.

!pip install llama-index
Simple Agent (no external tools)
Here we show a simple example with the built-in code interpreter.

Let’s start by importing some simple building blocks.

If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAssistantAgent
agent = OpenAIAssistantAgent.from_new(
    name="Math Tutor",
    instructions="You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions.",
    openai_tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}],
    instructions_prefix="Please address the user as Jane Doe. The user has a premium account.",
)
agent.thread_id
'thread_ctzN0ZY3JUWETHhYxI3DiFSo'
response = agent.chat(
    "I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?"
)
print(str(response))
The solution to the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\) is \(x = 1\).
Assistant with Built-In Retrieval
Let’s test the assistant by having it use the built-in OpenAI Retrieval tool over a user-uploaded file.

Here, we upload and pass in the file during assistant-creation time.

The other option is you can upload/pass the file-id in for a message in a given thread with upload_files and add_message.

from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAssistantAgent
agent = OpenAIAssistantAgent.from_new(
    name="SEC Analyst",
    instructions="You are a QA assistant designed to analyze sec filings.",
    openai_tools=[{"type": "retrieval"}],
    instructions_prefix="Please address the user as Jerry.",
    files=["data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf"],
    verbose=True,
)
response = agent.chat("What was Lyft's revenue growth in 2021?")
print(str(response))
Lyft's revenue increased by $843.6 million or 36% in 2021 as compared to the previous year【7†source】.
Assistant with Query Engine Tools
Here we showcase the function calling capabilities of the OpenAIAssistantAgent by integrating it with our query engine tools over different documents.

1. Setup: Load Data
from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAssistantAgent
from llama_index import (
    SimpleDirectoryReader,
    VectorStoreIndex,
    StorageContext,
    load_index_from_storage,
)

from llama_index.tools import QueryEngineTool, ToolMetadata
try:
    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(
        persist_dir="./storage/lyft"
    )
    lyft_index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context)

    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(
        persist_dir="./storage/uber"
    )
    uber_index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context)

    index_loaded = True
except:
    index_loaded = False

Assistant Agent with your own Vector Store / Retrieval API
LlamaIndex has 35+ vector database integrations. Instead of using the in-house Retrieval API, you can use our assistant agent over any vector store.

Here is our full list of vector store integrations. We picked one vector store (Supabase) using a random number generator.

from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAssistantAgent
from llama_index import (
    SimpleDirectoryReader,
    VectorStoreIndex,

    ),
    collection_name="base_demo",
)
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs, storage_context=storage_context)
# sanity check that the docs are in the vector store
num_docs = vector_store.get_by_id("lyft_docs", limit=1000)

Got output: Lyft's risk factors include general economic factors, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures, natural disasters, economic downturns, public health crises, or political crises. Operational factors, such as their limited operating history, financial performance, competition, unpredictability of results, uncertainty regarding market growth, ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders, insurance coverage, autonomous vehicle technology, reputation and brand, illegal or improper activity on the platform, accuracy of background checks, changes to pricing practices, growth and development of their network, ability to manage growth, security or privacy breaches, reliance on third parties, and ability to operate various programs and services.

Got output: Lyft responded to COVID-19 by adopting multiple measures, including establishing new health and safety requirements for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. They also made adjustments to their expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenues, which included headcount reductions in 2020. Additionally, Lyft temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals in cities most affected by COVID-19 and waived rental fees for drivers who tested positive for COVID-19 or were requested to quarantine by a medical professional. These measures were implemented to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on their business.
